# Python script to replace all detected characters in a Tesseract box file
# with the corresponding proofed data in a binsource file. The binsource data
# is assumed to contain parity. The page numbers must be supplied in the order
# they are present in the binsource file, and in general it's a good idea to
# supply the same number of page arguments as there are in the box file.
