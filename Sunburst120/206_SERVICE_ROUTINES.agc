# **SERVICER ROUTINES**
#       MOD NO. 00      MODIFICATION BY A. KOSMALA      NOV. 1966
#       MOD NO.  1      MODIFICATION BY D. LICKLY       JAN 1967
#   *FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION*

#     THE NORMAL ENTRY TO THE THRUST MISSION CONTROL PROGRAM IS THROUGH PREREAD.  PREREAD SCHEDULES THE JOB
# LASTBIAS.  BOOST PHASE ENTERS THE PREREAD ROUTINE AT BIBIBIAS, BYPASSING THE LASTBIAS JOB.  PIPS ARE CLEARED,
# AVERAGE G FLAG IS SET, DRIFT FLAG IS UNSET.  DV MONITOR AND FINDCUD ARE INITIALIZED, THE JOB NORMLIZE IS
# SCHEDULED, AND A WAITLIST CALL IS MADE TO START READACCS IN TWO SECONDS.

#     NORMLIZE PERFORMS THE SCALING AND INITIALIZATION REQUIRED PRIOR TO THE FIRST ENTRY TO AVERAGE G.

#     IN THE READACCS SECTION, THE ACCELEROMETERS ARE READ BY THE PIPASR SUBROUTINE.  IF THE AVERAGE G FLAG IS
# SET, READACCS IS CALLED TO RECYCLE IN TWO SECONDS.  IF THE AVERAGE G FLAG IS DOWN, AVERAGE G EXIT (AVEGEXIT)
# IS SET FOR THE FINAL PASS, AND READACCS IS NOT CALLED AGAIN.  IN EITHER CASE, THE SERVICER JOB IS ESTABLISHED.

#     THE SERVICER ROUTINE CHECKS FOR RUNAWAY PIPS (DELV GREATER THAN 3200 PULSES/SEC FOR 2 SEC) AND SENDS
# ALARM CODE 205 IF BAD PIP IS FOUND.  PIPS ARE COMPENSATED IN 1/PIPA SUBROUTINE, MASS IS UPDATED BY MASSMON
# SUBROUTINE, AND  AVERAGEG DOES THE NAVIGATION.  THE AVERAGE G ROUTINE UPDATES RN, VN, AND GDT/2 VECTORS, USING
# THE SUBROUTINE CALCRVG.  CONTROL IS THEN TRANSFERRED TO THE MONITOR SPECIFIED BY DVSELECT.  DVSELECT IS SET BY
# THE BOOST PHASE TO BOOSTMON, AND BY THE ENGINEON ROUTINE TO THE PGNCSMON.  USERS STARTING SERVICER BEFORE THE
# ENGINE IS ON SHOULD INSURE BYPASSING DVMON INITIALLY BY SETTING DVSELECT TO THE GENADR OF AVERAGE G.

#     THE BOOST MONITOR (BOOSTMON) CHECKS DELV AGAINST THRSHLD+, THE THRESHOLD ACCELERATION FOR THE BOOST PHASE.
# IF DELV IS BELOW THRESHOLD, INDICATING TERMINATION OF BOOST, MISSION PHASE 6 IS SCHEDULED AS A JOB, DVSELECT
# IS ALTERED TO BYPASS BOOSTMON AND PROCEED DIRECTLY TO AVERAGE G.

#     THE PGNCS MONITOR (PGNCSMON) COMPARES ACTUAL THRUST TO THE THRESHOLD VALUE FOR THE +X ACCELERATION
# (100 CM/SEC).  IF THRUST IS FOUND BELOW THIS VALUE FOR 3 CYCLES (I.E., 4 TO 6 SECONDS) AS DETERMINED BY DVCNTR,
# AND THE ENGINE FLAG IS REMOVED, (INDICATING THAT THE ENGINE HAS BEEN TURNED OFF) CONTROL IS BRANCHED TO THE
# LOCATION SPECIFIED BY DVMNEXIT, PREVIOUSLY SET BY THE USERS PROGRAM.  DVSELECT IS ALTERED TO BYPASS PNGCSMON IN
# SUBSEQUENT PASSES.  IF, HOWEVER, THE ENGINE FLAG IS STILL ON AT THIS TIME, CONTROL IS TRANSFERRED TO ENGNFAIL.
# THIS SENDS ALARM CODE 1405 AND KILLS THAT MISSION PHASE.  ANY TIME THE THRUST IS LESS THAN THE THRESHOLD VALUE,
# THE STEERING IS DETACHED (NO EXIT VIA AVEGEXIT) AND EXIT IS MADE THRU SERVEXIT.

#     THE NORMAL EXIT IS THRU AVEGEXIT, WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN SET BY THE USER. THE FINAL EXIT, SET INTO AVEGEXIT BY
# READACCS WHEN IT  FINDS THE AVERAGE G FLAG DOWN, SETS UP FREE FALL GYRO COMPENSATION, SETS THE DRIFT FLAG ON,
# PERFORMS AVETOMID ROUTINE, AND TRANSFERS CONTROL TO P00H, THUS CLEARING  ALL ACTIVITY UNTIL A NEW MISSION
# PHASE IS DUE.

# ***** WARNING TO USERS *****

# THE USER MUST SET DVMNEXIT TO THE 2CADR OF A JOB TO BE PERFORMED WHEN ENGINE SHUTDOWN IS DETECTED BY SERVICER.
# IN GENERAL, THE AVERAGE G FLAG WILL BE TURNED OFF BY THE USER AT THAT TIME, ALLOWING JUST ONE MORE PASS THROUGH
# AVERAGE G.  ALL ACTIVITY OF THE USERS MISSION PHASE MUST HAVE BEEN COMPLETED BEFORE THIS LAST PASS THROUGH
# AVERAGE G, DUE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF P00H AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

#     AVGEXIT MUST BE SET BY THE USER TO THE 2CADR OF THE JOB (E.G., STEERING) TO BE PERFORMED AFTER EACH PASS
# THROUGH AVERAGE G.  IF NO OTHER JOB IS TO BE DONE, AVEGEXIT SHOULD BE SET TO SERVEXIT.

## Page 816
#     USER MUST INITIALIZE DVSELECT TO THE GENADR OF AVERAGE G UNLESS THE ENGINEON ROUTINE HAS BEEN PERFORMED
# BEFORE THE START OF SERVICER.

#     USERS (EXCEPT FOR BOOST PHASE) MUST PERFORM MTDTOAVE ROUTINE BEFORE STARTING PREREAD.

# CALLING SEQUENCE IS NORMAL WAITLIST CALL FOR PREREAD.  (READACCS WILL START TWO SECONDS LATER.)
