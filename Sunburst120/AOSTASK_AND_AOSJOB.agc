# PROGRAM NAME: AOSTASK           MOD. NO. 1  DATE: NOVEMBER 20, 1966

# AUTHOR: JONATHAN D. ADDELSTON (ADAMS ASSOCIATES)

# THIS "WAITLIST TASK" IS EXECUTED EVERY 2 SECONDS DURING ASCENT (APS) BURNS.  IT ESTIMATES THE ACCELERATION DUE
# TO THE ENGINE OFF-SET.  TO USE THESE ESTIMATES, IT ALSO CALCULATES TERMS TO ADD INTO THE LM DAP RATE DERIVATION
# AND WEIGHTING FACTORS FOR THE ESTIMATE OF AOS AND FOR THE RATE DERIVATION.  FINALLY, IT ALSO SETS UP "AOSJOB"
# THROUGH THE EXECUTIVE TO CALCULATE FUMCTIONS OF THE AOS.

#          2. THE INVERSES OF THE MINIMUM ACCELERATIONS FOR THE URGENCY AND TJETLAW COMPUTATION, DURING APS BURNS.
#          3. THE INITIAL INVERSE NET ACCELERATIONS USED FOR THE URGENCY COMPUTATION, DURING APS BURNS.
#          4. THE NJ FLAGS TO REQUIRE MANDATORY JET ACCELERATION DURING APS BURNS.

# SUBROUTINE NAME: INVACC         MOD. NO. 0  DATE: DECEMBER 3, 1966

# AUTHOR: JONATHAN D. ADDELSTON (ADAMS ASSOCIATES)

# THIS SUBROUTINE IS CALLED BY AOSJOB TO CALCULATE:

#                0.5       WHERE TEMPNET IS SCALED AT PI/2 RADIANS/SECOND(2)
#     C(A) =   -------
#              TEMPNET     AND THE FRACTION IS SCALED AT 2(+8)/PI SEC(2)/RAD.

# THIS SIMPLE COMPUTATION WAS SUBROUTINIZED DUE TO ITS FREQUENT USE.

# CALLING SEQUENCE: TC  INVACC

# SUBROUTINES CALLED: NONE.       NORMAL EXIT MODE: ONE INSTRUCTION AFTER CALL.

# ALARM OR ABORT EXIT MODES: NONE.

# INPUT: TEMPNET SCALED AT PI/2 RADIANS/SECONDS(2).

# OUTPUT: C(A) SCALED AT 2(+8)/PI SECONDS(2)/RADIAN.

# DEBRIS: L,Q.
