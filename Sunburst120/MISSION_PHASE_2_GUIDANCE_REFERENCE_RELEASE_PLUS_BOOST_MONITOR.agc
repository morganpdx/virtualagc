# PROGRAM NAME - MISSION PHASE 2 GUIDANCE REFERENCE RELEASE + BOOST MONITOR.

# MODIFICATION NUMBER - 1         DATE - NOVEMBER 22, 1966                MODIFICATION BY - COVELLI



# FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION -

#    THE FUNCTION OF MISSION PHASE 2 IS TO CONTROL THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS IN THE 206 FLIGHT FROM GUIDANCE
# REFERENCE RELEASE THROUGH LIFTOFF TO THE SIVB BOOSTER SHUTDOWN.

#    AT GUIDANCE REFERENCE RELEASE, THE GRR FLAG IS SET,  PREREAD IS CALLED TO BEGIN COMPUTATION OF POSITION AND
# VELOCITY, AND CALLS ARE MADE FOR DFI T/M CALIBRATION AND LIFTOFF

#    WHEN PRELAUNCH DETECTS THAT THE GRR FLAG IS SET, IT TERMINATES GYROCOMPASSING AND CALLS MP2JOB. MP2JOB
# DISPLAYS 7 IN THE MAJOR MODE AND GOES TO MATRXJOB TO COMPUTE REFSMMAT.

#    AT LIFTOFF, THE LGC CLOCK IS ZEROED, CALLS ARE MADE FOR THE COLD FIRE PURGE AND POST LET JETTISON PROGRAMS.
# THE MAJOR MODE IS CHANGED TO 11.

#    AT POST LET JETTISON, THE DV MONITOR IS ENABLED TO DETECT BOOSTER SHUTDOWN, THE ABORT COMMAND MONITOR AND THE
# TUMBLE MONITOR ARE ENABLED, AND THE MAJOR MODE IS CHANGED TO 12.

#    THE VARIOUS LMP COMMANDS REQUIRED FOR MP2 ARE SCHEDULED BY WAITLIST CALLS.

#    AT DETECTION OF SIVB SHUTDOWN, AN EXECUTIVE CALL IS MADE TO MISSION PHASE 6.



# CALLING SEQUENCE :

#    MISSION PHASE 2 IS BEGUN UPON RECEIPT OF THE GUIDANCE REFERENCE RELEASE SIGNAL (VERB 65 ENTER) VIA UPLINK.



# SUBROUTINES CALLED :

#          PREREAD                1LMP

#          SPVAC                  IBNKCALL
#          WAITLIST
#          LONGCALL



# NORMAL EXIT MODES :
## Page 674
#    EXIT TO MISSION PHASE 6 AT SIVB SHUTDOWN.



# ABORT EXIT MODES :

#    TO MISSION PHASE 3 IF SUBORBITAL ABORT COMMAND RECEIVED VIA UPLINK.
#    TO MISSION PHASE 4 IF CONTINGENCY ORBIT INSERTION COMMAND RECEIVED VIA UPLINK.
#    TO CHARALRM IF EITHER OF THE ABOVE ABORT COMMANDS RECEIVED WHILE ABORT COMMAND MONITOR NOT ENABLED.



# OUTPUT :

#          TGRR          TIME OF GUIDANCE REFERENCE RELEASE
#          TPRELTER      TIME OF GYROCOMPASSING TERMINATION

# MOD BY: MILLER, LICKLY, KERNAN                                          ASSEMBLY: SUNBURST REVISION 79

# FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION

#          THIS PROGRAM CONSTRUCTS THE MATRIX WHICH RELATES THE STABLE MEMBER INERTIAL FRAME TO THE REFERENCE
# FRAME (Z NORTH, X ALONG THE VERNAL EQUINOX.)

#          TWO INTERMEDIATE COORDINATE SYSTEMS ARE USED: A LOCAL, EARTH FIXED, VERTICAL, SOUTH, EAST SYSTEM AND AN
# EARTH REFERENCE X, Y, Z SYSTEM.  IN THIS LATTER SYSTEM, THE Z AXIS IS THE EARTH'S ROTATION AXIS, THE X AXIS IS
# NORMAL TO Z IN THE PLANE OF Z AND THE LOCAL VERTICAL, POSITIVE IN THE DIRECTION OF V.  Y IS Z CROSS X.

#          THE FIRST COMPUTATION IS OF AZGR, THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE REFERENCE INERTIAL AND EARTH REFERENCE X-Z
# PLANES (THE Z AXES ARE COINCIDENT).  AZGR IS COMPUTED BY CONVERTING THE TIME FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE EPHEMERIS
# YEAR TO RELEASE (TEPHEM + TPRELTER) TO REVOLUTIONS (DAYS).  THE WHOLE REVS ARE DISCARDED AND THE INITIAL ANGLE
# (AZ0) BETWEEN THE GREENWICH MERIDIAN AND THE REFERENCE X-Z PLANES IS ADDED.  ADDING THE LONGITUDE YIELDS AZGR.

#          THE FOLLOWING COMPUTATIONS ARE THEN PERFORMED.

# LOCAL VERTICAL(ER) = COS(LATITUDE), 0, SIN(LATITUDE)  IN EARTH REFERENCE

# LOCAL VERTICAL(IR) = COS(LAT)COS(AZGR), COS(LAT)SIN(AZGR), SIN(LAT)  IN INERTIAL REFERENCE

# LOCAL EAST(IR) = UNIT(NXV) = -SIN(AZGR), COS(AZGR), 0  IN INERTIAL REFERENCE

# LOCAL SOUTH(IR) = E(IR) X V(IR)

#          THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE STABLE MEMBER AXES TO THE V. S, F AXES IS GIVEN BY ZSMAZ, THE ANGLE FROM NORTH
# TO ZSM, AND TILT, THE ANGLE ABOUT ZSM FROM VERTICAL TO XSM.

# ZSM(IR) = EAST(IR)SIN(ZSMAZ) - SOUTH(IR)COS(ZSMAZ)

# YSM(IR) = (ZSM(IR) X V(IR))COS(TILT) - V(IR)SIN(TILT)

# XSM(IR) = YSM(IR) X ZSM(IR)

#          THESE THREE HALF-UNIT VECTORS, XSM(IR), YSM(IR), AND ZSM(IR) ARE THE SM AXES EXPRESSED IN INERTIAL
# REFERENCE COORDINATES AND THEY FORM REFSMMAT, THE REFERENCE TO STABLE MEMBER MATRIX.

# THE INPUT (PRELAUNCH ERASABLE LOAD) REQUIREMENTS ARE:

# 1) TEPHEM       THE TRIPLE PRECISION TIME IN CENTISECONDS FROM MIDNIGHT JULY 1, OF THE EPHEMERIS YEAR TO
# MIDNIGHT OF THE LAUNCH DAY (SIDEREAL CONVERTED TO MEAN SOLAR.)

#    IT IS ASSUMED THAT DURING THE LAUNCH COUNTDOWN THE LGC CLOCK (TIME2, TIME1) WILL BE ALIGNED TO REFLECT A
# ZERO VALUE AT MIDNIGHT OF THE LAUNCH DAY.  IF NOT, THE DIFFERENCE MUST BE ADDED TO TEPHEM.

# 2) TILT         THE ROTATION OF XSM ABOUT ZSM (RIGHT HAND RULE) FROM VERTICAL IN REVOLUTIONS.

## Page 678
# 3) ZSMAZ        THE ANGLE FROM NORTH TO ZSM IN REVOLUTIONS.

# THE OUTPUTS OF THIS PROGRAM ARE:

# 1) REFSMMAT     THE HALF-UNIT MATRIX WHICH TRANSFORMS FROM REFERENCE INERTIAL TO SM INERTIAL.

# 2) AZGR         THE ANGLE BETWEEN PAD 37 B VERTICAL AND THE REFERENCE X-Z PLANE IN REVOLUTIONS.
