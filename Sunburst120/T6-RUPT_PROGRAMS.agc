# PROGRAM NAMES: (1) DOT6RUPT     MOD. NO. 4  DATE: FEBRUARY 9. 1967

#                (2) T6JOBCHK

# MODIFICATION BY: JONATHAN D. ADDELSTON (ADAMS ASSOCIATES)

# THESE PROGRAMS ENABLE THE LM DAP TO CONTROL THE THRUST TIMES OF THE REACTION CONTROL SYSTEM JETS BY USING TIME6.
# SINCE THE LM DAP MAINTAINS EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OVER TIME6 AND ITS INTERRUPTS, THE FOLLOWING CONVENTIONS HAVE BEEN
# ESTABLISHED AND MUST NOT BE TAMPERED WITH:
#          1. NO NUMBER IS EVER PLACED INTO TIME6 EXCEPT BY LM DAP.
#          2. NO PROGRAM OTHER THAN LM DAP ENABLES THE TIME6 COUNTER.
#          3. ONLY POSITIVE NUMBERS ARE ENTERED INTO TIME6, SO IT COUNTS DOWN TO -0 (MINUS ZERO) TO INTERRUPT.
#          4. IF -0 IS NOT IN TIME6 WHEN THE INTERRUPT OCCURS, THEN THE INTERRUPT HAS ALREADY BEEN PROCESSED.
#          5  ALL PROGRAMS WHICH OPERATE IN EITHER INTERRUPT MODE OR WITH INTERRUPT INHIBITED MUST CALL T6JOBCHK
#             EVERY 6 MILLISECONDS TO PROCESS A POSSIBLE WAITING T6RUPT BEFORE IT CAN BE HONORED BY THE HARDWARE.

# SUBROUTINES CALLED:   DOT6RUPT CALLS T6JOBCHK.

# NORMAL EXIT MODES:    DOT6RUPT TRANSFERS CONTROL TO RESUME.

# ALARM/ABORT MODES:    NONE.

# INPUT: TIME6,T6NEXT REGS,T6NEXTJT REGS.

# OUTPUT: (SAME AS INPUT.)

# DEBRIS: DOT6RUPT: NONE.  T6JOBCHK: A,L
# *** NOTE: AS OF MOD. NO. 2, T6NEXT AND T6NEXTJT LISTS ARE IN UNSWITCHED ERASABLE. ***
