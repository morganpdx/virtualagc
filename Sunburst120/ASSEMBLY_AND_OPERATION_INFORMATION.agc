## Filename:	ASSEMBLY_AND_OPERATION_INFORMATION.agc
## Purpose:	A module for revision 0 of BURST120 (Sunburst).
##		It is part of the source code for the Lunar Module's (LM)
##		Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) for Apollo 5.
## Assembler:	yaYUL
## Contact:	Ron Burkey <info@sandroid.org>.
## Website:	www.ibiblio.org/apollo/index.html
## Mod history:	2016-09-30 RSB	Created draft version.  Corrected it against the 
##				Sunburst 120 scans, so should be ready to go 
##				except for any errors I may have introduced myself.
