# CONTROL REACHES THIS POINT UNDER EITHER OF THE FOLLOWING TWO CONDITIONS ONCE THE DESCENT ENGINE AND THE DIGITAL
# AUTOPILOT ARE BOTH ON:
#          A) THE TRIM GIMBAL CONTROL LAW WAS ON DURING THE PREVIOUS Q,R-AXIS TIME5 INTERRUPT (OR THE DAPIDLER
#             INITIALIZATION WAS SET FOR TRIM GIMBAL CONTROL AND THIS IS THE FIRST PASS), OR
#          B) THE Q,R-AXES RCS JET CONTROL LAW ATTITUDE STEERING MODE REDUCED THE ATTITUDE ERROR TO LESS THAN
# 1DEGREE ON EACH AXIS ON ITS LAST TIME5 INTERRUPT.

# THE FOLLOWING T5RUPT ENTRY BEGINS THE TRIM GIMBAL CONTROL LAW.  SINCE IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE LEM WILL REMAIN
# UNDER TRIM GIMBAL CONTROL, A KALMAN FILTER RUPT IS SET UP TO BEGIN 30 MS FROM THE TRIM GIMBAL RUPT.

# PROGRAM DESIGN BY: RICHARD D. GOSS (MIT/IL)

# PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION BY: JONATHAN D. ADDELSTON (ADAMS ASSOCIATES)

# MODIFIED 30 NOV 66, TO USE ACCDOTQ AND ACCDOTR.              CRAIG WORK
# MODIFIED AUGUST '67 TO CHANGE CALLING SEQUENCE AND MAKE MAXTIME ERASABLE          PETER WEISSMAN

# THIS SUBROUTINE CALCULATES THE TRIM GIMBAL SHUTDOWN TIME FOR EITHER THE Q OR THE R AXIS (DEPENDING ON THE
# CALLING SEQUENCE).  THIS TIME IS SCALED FOR IMMEDIATE USE BY A WAITLIST CALL AS SHOWN IN THE CALLING SEQUENCES.
# IF THE TIME-TO-GO IS MORE THAN 'DRIVELIM', IT IS LIMITED TO 'MAXTIME'. IF
# THE TIME-TO-GO IS LESS THAN TEN MILLISECONDS, THE SHUTDOWN IS PERFORMED IMMEDIATELY AND THE WAITLIST CALL IS
# BY-PASSED.

# THESE TIME-TO-GO CALCULATIONS ARE DESIGNED TO DRIVE THE TRIM GIMBAL TO A POSITION WHERE THE DESCENT ENGINE WILL
# CAUSE NO ANGULAR ACCELERATION.  THIS SUBROUTINE IS CALLED ONLY FROM THE WAITLIST TASK CHEKDRIV WHICH IS
# INITIATED ONLY WHEN THE TRIM GIMBAL CONTROL LAW HAS LOST CONTROL OF THE LEM VEHICLE ATTITUDE AND MUST RETURN TO
# THE USE OF REACTION CONTROL SYSTEM JETS.
