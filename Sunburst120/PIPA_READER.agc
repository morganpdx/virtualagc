# *****  PIPA READER *****

#                 MOD NO. 00  BY D. LICKLY  DEC.9 1966

# FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION

#    SUBROUTINE TO READ PIPA COUNTERS, TRYING TO BE VERY CAREFUL SO THAT IT WILL BE RESTARTABLE.
#    PIPA READINGS ARE STORED IN THE VECTOR DELV. THE HIGH ORDER PART OF EACH COMPONENT CONTAINS THE PIPA READING,
#    RESTARTS BEGIN AT REREADAC.


#    AT THE END OF THE PIPA READER THE CDUS ARE READ AND STORED AS A
# VECTOR IN CDUTEMP.  THE HIGH ORDER PART OF EACH COMPONENT CONTAINS
# THE CDU READING IN 25 COMP IN THE ORDER CDUX,Y,Z.  THE THRUST
# VECTOR ESTIMATOR IN FINDCDUD REQUIRES THE CDUS BE READ AT PIPTIME.

# CALLING SEQUENCE AND EXIT

#    CALL VIA TC, ISWCALL, ETC.

#    EXIT IS VIA Q.


# INPUT

#    INPUT IS THROUGH THE COUNTERS PIPAX, PIPAY, PIPAZ, AND TIME2.

# OUTPUT

#    HIGH ORDER COMPONENTS OF THE VECTOR DELV CONTAIN THE PIPA READINGS.
#    PIPTIME CONTAINS TIME OF PIPA READING.
