# PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:

#          AUTHOR:  J S MILLER    (MIT INSTRUMENTATION LAB))

#          THIS ROUTINE IS ATTACHED TO T4RUPT, AND IS ENTERED EVERY 960 MS.  ITS FUNCTION IS TO EXAMINE THE STATE
# OF THE LOW 8 BITS OF CHAN 32 TO SEE IF RCS-JET FAILURE BITS HAVE APPEARED OR DISAPPEARED.  WHEN A STATE CHANGE
# IS DETECTED WHICH PERSISTS FOR 2 SAMPLES (TO FILTER OUT NOISY SIGNALS), AN LMP COMMAND IS SENT (BUT AT MOST ONE
# SUCH COMMAND PER SAMPLE) TO ISOLATE THE APPROPRIATE JET PAIR IF THE FAILURE SIGNAL HAS JUST APPEARED.  IF, ON
# THE OTHER HAND, THE DISAPPEARANCE OF A FAIL-BIT IS DETECTED, THE EVENT IS PRESUMED TO BE THE RESULT OF THE
# GROUND HAVING SENT AN LMP COMMAND TO OPEN THE ISOLATION VALVE AND NO SUBSEQUENT FAILURE HAVING BEEN DETECTED BY
# THE DETECTION CIRCUITRY.  IN EITHER CASE, THIS FAILURE-MONITOR PROGRAM RESPONDS BY UPDATING ITS RECORD OF THE
# STATE OF THE ISOLATION VALVES, AND ALSO THE PAIR OF WORDS IT MAINTAINS FOR USE BY THE DAP IN THE JET-POLICY
# SELECTION LOGIC.

#          A FEW WORDS ABOUT LMP-RESET COMMANDS:  IN THE CYCLE IN WHICH A VALVE-CLOSURE COMMAND IS ISSUED, THE
# CORRESPONDING RESET COMMAND IS STORED IN THE REGISTER "JETRESET".  THIS REGISTER IS EXAMINED AT THE BEGINNING OF
# EACH RCSMONIT CYCLE, AND IF A COMMAND IS WAITING, IT IS SENT IMMEDIATELY.  THIS CAUSES RESET COMMANDS TO BE
# ISSUED AT ABOUT 960 MS AFTER THE SET COMMANDS.  THIS TECHNIQUE ASSURES THAT NO MORE THAN ONE UN-RESET SET-
# COMMAND IS ON AT ANY TIME (ALTHOUGH GROUND ACTIONS WILL BE SUPERIMPOSED ON THIS, HOWEVER).

# CALLING SEQUENCE:

#          TC     RCSMONIT        (IN INTERRUPT MODE, EVERY 960 MS.)
# EXIT:

#          TCF    RCSMONEX    (ALL PATHS EXIT VIA SUCH AN INSTRUCTION.  RCSMONEX IS PRESENTLY EQUATED TO RESUME.)

# ERASABLE INITIALIZATION REQUIRED:

#          VIA SLAP1:  JETRESET          = -0  (RESET-CMD BUFFER EMPTY)
#                      THISCH32          = +0  (NO FAILURES SENSED YET)
#                      CH5MASK, CH6MASK  = +0  (0'S IF JETS ARE OK)
#                      LMPJFAIL          = +0  (ISOLATION VALVES ALL OPEN)

# OUTPUT:

#          CH5MASK & CH6MASK UPDATED  (1'S WHERE JETS NOT TO BE USED)
#          THISCH32 SET TO INVERTED LOW 8 BITS OF CHAN 32 (HIGH 7 = 0)
#          LMPJFAIL UPDATED  (1'S WHEN ISOLATION COMMANDS HAVE BEEN SENT)
#          JETRESET CONTAINS RESET-COMMANDS TO BE SENT NEXT CYCLE THRU.

# DEBRIS:

#          A, L, Q, & RCSMONT1 - 4  (PRESENTLY EQUATED TO RUPTREG1 - 4)

# SUBROUTINES CALLED:

#          STORCOM  (PART OF 1LMP ROUTINE)
