#       THROTTLE CONTROL CAN BE USED IN EITHER OF TWO MODES: IN "PERCENTAGE MODE" (WHEN A CERTAIN FRACTION OF
# MAXIMUM THRUST IS DESIRED) AND IN "ACCELERATION MODE"  (WHEN THE THRUST DESIRED IS THAT CORRESPONDING TO A
# SPECIFIED ACCELERATION).

#                  PERCENTAGE MODE                                               ACCLERATION MODE

#       THE FRACTION OF MAXIMUM THRUST (NOMINALLY                     DESIRED ACCELERATION, IN DOUBLE PRECISION,
# 10500 POUNDS) DESIRED, IN SINGLE PRECISION, IS                IN UNITS OF 2(-5) M/CS/CS, IS PLACED IN /ACF/.
# PLACED IN PCNTF.   ENTRY IS VIA A DTCB AN THE                 ENTRY IS VIA A DTCB ON THE 2CADR OF THROTCON.
# 2CADR OF PCNTFMAX.   THE ROUTINE BEGINNING AT                 THE ROUTINE BEGINNING AT THROTCON SETS UP A JOB -
# PCNTFMAX SETS UP A JOB - PCNTJOB - AND RETURNS                ACCLJOB - AND RETURNS TO THE USER (AT THE
# TO THE USER (AT THE INSTRUCTION IMMEDIATELY                   INSTRUCTION FOLLOWING THE DTCB).
# FOLLOWING THE DTCB).
#                                                                    ACCLJOB, AFTER A RESTART PROTECT,
#       PCNTJOB, AFTER A RESTART PROTECT,                       COMPUTES DESIRED ACCELERATION, FC = /AFC/ MASS,
# TURNS OFF THE TRIM GIMBAL, SETS UP A WAITLIST                SCALED AT ABOUT 2.7 POUNDS PER BIT.
# TASK (DESCRIBED LOCALLY), COMPUTES THRUST DESIRED,
# FC = PCNTF FMAX, SCALED AT ABOUT 2.7 POUNDS PER BIT,                (NOTE THAT IN THE ACCELERATION MODE THE TRIM
# AND TCF'S AROUND THE COMMENCEMENT OF ACCLJOB TO               GIMBAL IS NOT TURNED OFF; IT IS ASSUMED TO BE OFF
# FOLDCALC.                                                    BY THE TIME THROTTLE CHANGES ARE COMMANDED.

#       FOLDCALC BEGINS BY COMPUTING PRESENT THRUST,  FOLD = MASS /AF/,  SCALED AS IS FC.   NEXT, SINCE /AF/ IS
# MERELY AN "AVERAGE" OF THE THROTTLE LEVELS OF THE PRECEEDING PIPA INTERVAL, FOLD IS WEIGHTED BY FWEIGHT, A
# FUNCTION OF THE PRECEEDING THROTTLE COMMAND (DESCRIBED LOCALLY).   TO PRECLUDE A SPURIOUS WEIGHTING THAT WOULD
# OTHERWISE OCCUR, FWEIGHT IS ZEROED 1.95 SECONDS AFTER EVERY PERCENTAGE MODE THROTTLING.

#       NEXT, TO COMPENSATE FOR THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN BITS FOR MAXIMUM THRUST AND BITS FOR FULL THROTTLE, THE
# NUMBER  FOLD - FODD IS COMPUTED AND SET INTO PIFPSET WHENEVER FCOLD INDICATES THE THROTTLE IS AT MAXIMUM.
# SINCE PIFPSET IS USED, RATHER THAN PIF, PIF STILL REFLECTS ACCURATELY THE ACTUAL THRUST CHANGE AND FWEIGHT IS
# COMPUTED PROPERLY.

#       NEXT COMES IS-IT-ON.   HERE THE ENGINE-OFF BIT (14 OF CHANNEL 11) IS QUERIED; IF THE ENGINE IS OFF
# FCOLD, THE SINGLE PRECISION HISTORY REGISTER, IS SET TO 10% FMAX AND PIFPSET, A PRESETTING ADDED TO PIF AT
# THE LAST MOMENT, IS SET TO -10% FMAX TO COMPENSATE FOR THE ASSUMED SETTING OF THE MANUAL THROTTLE.

#       THE SERIES OF DECISIONS BEGINNING AT WHERETO CAUSES THE THROTTLE TO REACT TO USERS' DESIRES IN THE
# MANNER DESCRIBED BY FIGURE 5.3-5 OF THE FLIGHT 206 GSOP.   WHERETO PROCEEDS (OR BRANCHES) TO FLATOUT (IF THE
# THROTTLE LEVEL ASKED FOR IS IN THE FORBIDDEN REGION) OR TO DOPIF.   FLATOUT RESETS FC TO 94% FMAX, SETS FEXTRA
# (A BOOST GIVEN TO THE THROTTLE TO KEEP IT JAMMED AGAINST ITS STOPS) INTO PIFPSET, AND PROCEEDS TO DOPIF.

#       DOPIF, AFTER A "TYPE C" RESTART PROTECT (NECESSITATED BY THE FACT THAT FCOLD AND PIF, USED EARLIER, ARE
# ABOUT TO BE MODIFIED), SETS FCOLD = FC, COMPUTES PIF (PULSE INCREMENT FOR ACCELERATION) = FC - FOLD, AND, AS
# IT PROCEEDS TO DOIT, HAS THIS NUMBER PLUS PIFPSET IN A & L.

#       DOIT DOES IT.   IT TS'S INTO THRUST, THE CHANNEL (55) LEADING TO DECA, THE THROTTLE-AGC INTERFACE
# CIRCUIT, AND SETS BIT 4 IN CHANNEL 11, THE SIGNAL FOR THRUST TO BE COUNTED DOWN (AT 3200 PPS).   FINALLY,
# FWEIGHT = F(PIF) IS COMPUTED FOR USE NEXT PASS.

#       AFTER ANOTHER RESTART PROTECT A TCF ENDOFJOB ENDS THROTTLE CONTROL.
