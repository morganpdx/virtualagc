# PROGRAM: POLTYPEP                MOD. NO. 1  DATE: NOVEMBER 14, 1966

# AUTHOR:  JONATHAN D. ADDELSTON (ADAMS ASSOCIATES)

# THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO SELECT A POLICY OF JETS (OF WHICH NONE HAVE FAILED) WHICH CAN BE USED TO CREATE THE
# ROTATION AND/OR TRANSLATION WHICH IS REQUIRED BY THE LM DAP.  FROM THE INDEX "NETACNDX" (WHICH MUST BE SET WHEN
# ROTATION IS REQUESTED), THE OPTIMAL POLICY IS SELECTED.  WHEN FAILURES ARE DETECTED WITHIN A CHOSEN POLICY, AN
# ALTERNATE POLICY IS SELECTED.  IF ALL ALTERNATE POLICIES ARE EXHAUSTED WITHOUT FINDING AN UNFAILED POLICY, A JET
# FAILURE ABORT IS INITIATED.  WHEN THE ROUTINE IS USE FOR TRANSLATION JETS ONLY, "TRANONLY" MUST BE SET POSITIVE
# (NONZERO) AND THE ENTRY POINT IS "+/-XTRAN".

# CALLING SEQUENCES:

# 1. FOR ROTATION (WITH POSSIBLE +X TRANSLATION):
