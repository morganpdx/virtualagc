# THIS SUBROUTINE SETS THE ICDU DRIVE BITS EVERY OTHER TIME IT IS CALLED.  IT ALWAYS CHANGES THE VALUE OF
# "DISPLACT" TO INDICATE THE PASSING OF 100 MS, SINCE THIS FLAG IS TESTED BY "EIGHTBAL" IN THE P-AXIS T5RUPT.
# THE ICDU IS DRIVEN ONLY 30 MS AFTER "EIGHTBAL" ENABLED IT.

# CALLING SEQUENCES (FROM "DUMMYFIL" AND "FILTER"):

# SUBROUTINES CALLED: NONE.       NORMAL EXIT: BY TC Q  TO L +1 .

# ALARM/ABORT MODES: NONE.        INPUT: PRESENT VALUE IN  DISPLACT ,

# OUTPUT: OPPOSITE VALUE OF "DISPLACT" AND ICDU BITS (WHEN NECESSARY).
