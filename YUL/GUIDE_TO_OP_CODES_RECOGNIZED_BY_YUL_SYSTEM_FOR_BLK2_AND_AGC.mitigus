 0002              THIS DOCUMENT LISTS ALPHABETICALLY ALL THE OPERATION CODES (CARD COLUMNS 18-23) RECOGNIZED BY THE YUL
 0003   ASSEMBLERS FOR BLK2 AND AGC.  EACH OP CODE IS ACCOMPANIED BY SOME VITAL STATISTICS: TYPE, ONE OR TWO REFERENCES
 0004   (CITATIONS) TO FULLER DOCUMENTATION, EQUIVALENT NAME(S), SCOPE (DEGREE OF GENERALITY), MEANING OF APPENDED
 0005   ASTERISK, AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ABBREVIATION.  THERE IS ALSO A PAGE WITH SIMILAR INFORMATION ON ALL LEGAL
 0006   CONTENTS OF COLUMNS 1 AND 8.  DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF THE COLUMNS OF THE OP CODE GUIDE FOLLOW.

 0012   OP CODE:  THE ALPHABETIC ORDERING IS THE CLASSICAL PUNCHED-CARD COLLATING SEQUENCE: BLANK, SPECIAL CHARACTERS,
 0014   ALPHABET, NUMERALS.  EVERY OP CODE SHOWN WITH AN ASTERISK, E.G. BBCON*, IS ALSO LEGAL WITHOUT IT, E.G. BBCON.

 0016   TYPE:  OP CODES ARE CLASSIFIED INTO THE FOLLOWING TYPES:

 0017     ADR CON  (ADDRESS CONSTANT), ONE OR TWO WORDS MADE UP OF ONE OR MORE ADDRESSES BUT NO MACHINE OP CODES;
 0019     CLERICAL, AN INSTRUCTION TO THE ASSEMBLER RATHER THAN TO THE AGC;
 0020     INSTR    (INSTRUCTION), A WORD DIRECTLY EXECUTABLE BY THE AGC;
 0021     MERGE    (MERGE CONTROL CARD), AN INSTRUCTION TO THE FILE-UPDATING PART OF THE YUL SYSTEM, GOVERNING MERGING
 0023              OF INPUT CARDS WITH OLD PROGRAM;
 0024     NUM CON  (NUMERIC CONSTANT), ONE OR TWO WORDS REPRESENTING A NUMBER;
 0025     PRET OP  (INTERPRETIVE OP CODE), PACKED 2 TO A WORD IN INTERPRETIVE PROGRAMS; AND
 0027     ONSOLETE, ONE CODE (MODIFY) WHICH IS RECOGNIZED BY YUL-1800, BUT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING USEFUL.

 0030  *  D (DIGEST), HUGH BLAIR-SMITH, "A YUL PROGRAMMER'S DIGEST," REVISION 9, DECEMBER 13, 1967 (COMPUTER PRINTOUT);
 0032     G (GUIDE), THIS DOCUMENT;
 0033     I (INTERPRETER BOOK), CHARLES A. MUNTZ, "USERS GUIDE TO THE BLOCK II AGC/LGC INTERPRETER," APRIL 1965 (R-489);

 0041   EACH CITATION IS GIVEN IN THE FORM R/PP; I.E. Y/80 MEANS PAGE 80 OF REFERENCE Y.  IN MOST OF THE CITATIONS OF
 0043   THE DIGEST, A SPECIAL SERIES OF PAGE NUMBERS IS USED: C1, C2, C3, C4.  EACH OF THESE REFERS TO TWO PLACES AT
 0045   ONCE, ONE IN THE SECTION "AGC BLOCK II INTERPRETIVE CODES: ASSEMBLY RULES FOR BLK2" AND ONE IN THE SECTION
 0047   "AGC BLOCK II INTERPRETIVE CODES: ASSEMBLY RULES FOR AGC."  FOR EXAMPLE, C2 REFERS TO "USER'S OWN PAGE NO.  2"
 0049   IN BOTH SECTIONS.  THIS DEVICE HELPS IN FINDING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO ASSEMBLERS.  THE "PAGE NUMBER"
 0051   IN A YUL TIP CITATION IS REALLY THE SERIAL NUMBER OF THE TIP.  WHERE TWO CITATIONS ARE GIVEN, THE FIRST IS THE
 0053   BETTER OR MORE BASIC ONE.

 0054   SAME AS:  AN OP CODE IN THIS COLUMN HAS EXACTLY THE SAME EFFECT ON THE ASSEMBLER AS THE ONE ON THE LEFT, THOUGH
 0056   PROGRAMMING CONVENTIONS SOMETIMES MAKE AN ARTIFICIAL DISTINCTION, AS BETWEEN "EQUALS" AND "=" IN DISKERAS ETC.
 0058   WHEN AN OP CODE IN THIS COLUMN IS DEFINITELY A LESS PREFERRED ONE, IT IS ENCLOSED IN ANGLE BRACKETS <THUS>.

 0060   SCOPE:  AN OP CODE MARKED "GEN" IS GENERAL, THAT IS, THE SAME FOR ALL COMPUTERS SERVED BY YUL-1800, EXCEPT
 0062   INSOFAR AS PARAMETERS SUCH AS WORD LENGTH MAKE A DIFFERENCE.  IF IT IS MARKED "SAME," IT IS UNIQUE TO THE BLOCK
 0064   II AGC, BUT THE SAME IN THE BLK2 AND AGC ASSEMBLERS.  "DIFF" MEANS THAT THE OP CODE IS TREATED DIFFERENTLY BY
 0066   THE BLK2 AND AGC ASSEMBLERS, IN WAYS THAT CAN BE FOUND THROUGH THE CITATIONS.

 0068   EFFECT OF *:  THE OPTIONAL ASTERISK EITHER MEANS INTERPRETIVE INDEXING OR IT HAS SOME MORE SPECIAL MEANING THAT CAN
 0070   BE FOUND THROUGH THE CITATION IN THIS COLUMN.

 0071   SIGNIFICANCE OF ABBREVIATION:  USUALLY, THE PURPOSE OF THIS COLUMN IS SIMPLY TO SHOW WHICH WORDS WERE COM-
 0073   PRESSED, BENT, FOLDED, AND MUTILATED TO FORM THE OP CODE.  WHENEVER THIS YIELDS LITTLE MEANING, ESPECIALLY IN
 0075   THE RARELY USED CODES, THERE IS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  HOWEVER, THIS COLUMN IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR THE CITED
 0077   REFERENCES FOR FINDING OUT WHAT A GIVEN OP CODE REALLY DOES.

 0608   NOTES ON SOME OP CODES
 0609   ----------------------


 0610   (BLANK), <P>

 0611           THIS IS THE CODE FOR INTERPRETIVE ADDRESS CONSTANTS.  REFER TO D/C1-D/C4 FOR THE NUMBER AND KINDS OF
 0613   ADDRESSES REQUIRED BY EACH INTERPRETIVE OP CODE.  THIS OP CODE IS REQUIRED FOR ALL KINDS OF ADDRESSES EXCEPT C;
 0615   C ADDRESSES ARE REALLY OPERANDS AND MAY HAVE THIS OR ANY OTHER OP CODE THAT GENERATES A ONE-WORD CONSTANT OR
 0617   INSTRUCTION.


 0618   =, EQUALS, <IS>

 0619           THE RULES GOVERNING ADDRESS SYMBOLS NOT PREDEFINED IN PASS 1, GIVEN AT Y/81, HAVE BEEN IMPROVED.  THE
 0621   CURRENT RULE IS THIS: IF THE ADDRESS SYMBOL HAS NOT BEEN PREDEFINED WHEN THE EQUALS CARD REFERRING TO IT IS
 0623   ENCOUNTERED IN PASS 1, THEN THE LOCATION SYMBOL IS STORED IN THE SYMBOL TABLE WITH A POINTER TO THE ADDRESS
 0625   SYMBOL'S PLACE IN THE TABLE (DEFINER THREAD) AND A 16-BIT FIELD CONTAINING THE SIGNED MODIFIER FROM THE ADDRESS
 0627   FIELD, AND THE ADDRESS SYMBOL IS STORED IN THE SYMBOL TABLE WITH A POINTER TO THE LOCATION SYMBOL'S PLACE
 0629   (DEFINEE THREAD).  THERE ARE ALSO SOME COMPLICATIONS TO COVER THE CASE OF A SYMBOL THAT DEFINES SEVERAL SYMBOLS.
 0631   THE UPSHOT OF ALL THIS IS THAT AN INTERMEDIATE PASS, CALLED PASS 1.5, RUNS AROUND THE SYMBOL TABLE CLEANING UP
 0633   ALL UNFINISHED EQUALS DEFINITIONS BEFORE PASS 2 BEGINS.  IF A DEFINER IS UNDEFINED OR ILL-DEFINED, ITS WHOLE
 0635   TREE OF DEFINEES IS CALLED "NEARLY DEFINED," MEANING THAT THE FORM OF THE EQUALS DEFINITION IS ALL RIGHT, AND
 0637   ONLY THE DEFINITION OF THE ADDRESS SYMBOL IS LACKING.  SIMILARLY, ALL MEMBERS OF A VICIOUS CIRCLE OF EQUALS
 0639   DEFINITIONS, AND THEIR OTHER DEFINEES, ARE CALLED "NEARLY DEFINED."  TO TAKE SOME EXAMPLES FROM Y/81:

 0641   OUT1     IS     BNK -4
 0642   BNK      EQUALS 15              PUTS INTO THE SYMBOL TABLE:

 0643           LOCA:    OUT1                   LOCB:  BNK
 0644                    -4         (N)                15           (=)         (N FOR NEARLY DEF., = FOR DEF. BY =.)
 0646                    LOCB       0                  0            LOCA        (DEFINER THREAD AND DEFINEE THREAD)

 0648   WHEN PASS 1.5 FINDS OUT1 DURING ITS SCAN OF NEARLY DEFINED SYMBOLS, IT FOLLOWS THE DEFINER THREAD TO LOCB, WHERE
 0650   IT FINDS THE DEFINITION OF BNK.  IT THEN FOLLOWS THE DEFINEE THREAD TO LOCA, AND FILLS IN THE DEFINITION OF
 0652   OUT1.  THE SYMBOL TABLE ENTRIES BECOME:

 0653           LOCA:    OUT1                   LOCB:  BNK
 0654                    11         (=)                15           (=)
 0655                    0          0                  0            0

 0656           THE IMPLICATION FOR THE PROGRAMMER IS THAT A TREE OF EQUALS DEFINITIONS MAY HAVE ANY DEPTH, BE OF ANY
 0658   COMPLEXITY, AND THE DEFINITIONS MAY BE IN ANY ORDER, PROVIDED ONLY THAT THE TREE IS LOGICALLY VALID.  THERE IS,
 0660   HOWEVER, ONE VERY SMALL REWARD FOR HAVING A PREDEFINED ADDRESS SYMBOL: THE ADDRESS FIELD MODIFIER MAY LIE
 0662   OUTSIDE THE RANGE -32767D TO +32767D, BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO FIT INTO A 16-BIT FIELD.

# Page 36
#      @GUIDE TO OP CODES RECOGNIZED BY YUL SYSTEM FOR BLK2 AND AGC              USER'S OWN PAGE NO.  11        PAGE  11

 0664   =MINUS

 0665           THIS CODE OPERATES BY SUBTRACTING THE LOCATION COUNTER VALUE FROM THE ADDRESS FIELD MODIFIER AND PRO-
 0667   CEEDING EXACTLY AS FOR EQUALS, SO THE RESTRICTION AT THE END OF THE PRECEDING NOTE COULD BECOME IMPORTANT.
 0669   HOWEVER, IT IS STILL EASY TO GET AROUND: SUPPOSE TABLE AND ENDTABLE ARE KNOWN TO BE IN SUPER-BANK 4, THEN

 0671            SETLOC TABLE
 0672   SIZTABLE =MINUS ENDTABLE        WORKS ONLY IF ENDTABLE IS PREDEFINED.

 0673   THE ESCAPE IS TO WRITE INSTEAD:

 0674            SETLOC TABLE -20000
 0675   TEMTABLE =MINUS ENDTABLE
 0676   SIZTABLE EQUALS TEMTABLE -20000


 0677   =PLUS

 0678           THIS CODE OPERATES BY ADDING THE LOCATION COUNTER VALUE TO THE ADDRESS FIELD MODIFIER AND PROCEEDING
 0680   EXACTLY AS FOR EQUALS.  THEREFORE REMARKS SIMILAR TO THOSE FOR =MINUS APPLY TO =PLUS, THOUGH THE CASE IS MUCH
 0682   LESS LIKELY.


 0683   BANK

 0684           THIS CODE OPERATES SIMILARLY TO BLOCK, AS DESCRIBED AT Y/77, EXCEPT IN TWO RESPECTS: THE BLOCK SIZE IN
 0686   BLK2 AND AGC IS 1024D = 2000, AND THE BANK NUMBERS ARE 4 LESS THAN THE CORRESPONDING BLOCK NUMBERS, BECAUSE BANK
 0688   00 STARTS AT PSEUDO-ADDRESS 10000 INSTEAD OF 0.  EXAMPLES:

 0689            BANK   20              FIND FIRST UNUSED LOCATION IN BANK 20
 0690            BANK   0 +1400         FIND FIRST UNUSED LOCATION IN LAST PARAGRAPH OF BANK 20
 0692            BANK   3               IS ILLEGAL: THAT'S NONEXISTENT MEMORY
 0693            BANK                   FIND FIRST UNUSED LOCATION IN SAME BANK AS LOCATION COUNTER VALUE
 0695   SEE ALSO NOTE ON BLOCK.


 0696   BBCON*

 0697           BITS 7-5 OF A BBCON WORD CONTAIN THE CURRENT SBANK= SETTING (000 IF NONE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE
 6099   PROGRAM) OR, IF THE FIXED-BANK NUMBER IS 30 OR MORE, IT CONTAINS THE CORRESPONDING SUPER-BANK NUMBER, WHICH IS
 0701   ALWAYS THE EIGHTS' DIGIT OF THR BANK NUMBER.  IN THE AGC ASSEMBLER, THE E-BANK VALUE MUST BE GIVEN BY A ONE-SHOT
 0703   EBANK= DECLARATION.  THIS IS OPTIONAL IN BLK2.  IN EITHER ASSEMBLER, A ONE-SHOT SBANK= MAY BE USED UNLESS IT
 0705   CONFLICTS WITH THE FIXED-BANK VALUE.

 0706           THE STARRED VERSION, BBCON*, IS A SPECIAL IMPLIED-ADDRESS CONSTANT CREATED FOR THE BANKSUM CHECKING IN
 0708   SELFCHECK.  THE ADDRESS FIELD MUST BE LEFT BLANK, AND THE WORD IS ASSEMBLED AS IF THE ADDRESS HAD BEEN THE
 0710   HIGHEST ADDRESS OCCUPIED BY A WORD IN THIS ASSEMBLY.  ASIDE FROM THAT, ALL THE BBCON RULES APPLY.  THE EFFECT OF
 0712   THE BBCON* WORD IS TO TELL SELFCHECK WHICH IS THE LAST BANK THAT NEEDS ITS BANKSUM CHECKED.

 0714   BLOCK

 0715           THE MEMORY BLOCK SIZE IN BLK2 AND AGC IS 1024D = 2000, CONTRARY TO Y/77, WHICH GIVES THE BLOCK 1 AGC
 0717   PARAMETERS.  THE BLOCK NUMBER IS THEREFORE OBTAINED BY SHIFTING THE PSEUDO-ADDRESS RIGHT 10 BITS, I.E.

 0719   BLOCK #:   0      1        2,3         4        5       10       11             N
 0721   MEMORY:  E0-E3  E4-E7  FIXED-FIXED  BANK 00  BANK 01  BANK 04  BANK 05  ...  BANK N-4

 0723   AS FIXED-FIXED MEMORY HAS 2 BLOCK NUMBERS BUT NO BANK NUMBERS, IT IS NECESSARY TO USE BLOCK RATHER THAN BANK
 0725   WHEN SEEKING A FREE LOCATION IN FIXED-FIXED.

 0726           AN ADDRESS FORMAT HAS BEEN ADDED TO BLOCK AND BANK SINCE Y/77 WAS WRITTEN: BLANK OR PLUS-SIGNED NUMERIC:

 0728            BLOCK                  FIND FIRST FREE LOCATION IN SAME BLOCK AS LOCATION COUNTER VALUE
 0730            BLOCK  +1000           FIND FIRST FREE LOCATION IN LAST HALF OF SAME BLOCK AS LOCATION COUNTER VALUE

 0732   THE EFFECT IS TO ALLOW A BLOCK OR BANK CODE TO DEPEND ON A SYMBOLIC ADDRESS FIELD, WHICH IS LOCATED IN A PRE-
 0734   CEDING SETLOC.


 0735   BNKSUM

 0736           THIS CODE GENERATES THE END-OF-BANK PATTERN RECOGNIZED BY SELFCHECK IN ITS CHECKSUM TEST OF FIXED
 0738   MEMORY.  MORE IMMEDIATELY, THE PATTERN IS RECOGNIZED BY YUL PASS 3, WHICH COMPUTES CHECKSUM WORDS AND MAKES THEM
 0740   THE LAST OCCUPIED WORDS IN EACH BANK.  THE BLK2 AND AGC ASSEMBLERS TREAT BNKSUM THE SAME IN THE FOLLOWING
 0742   RESPECTS:

 0743   (1)     THE LOCATION FIELD SHOULD BE BLANK.

 0744   (2)     THE ADDRESS FIELD MUST CONTAIN EITHER A BANK NUMBER (THE USUAL CASE) OR AN ADDRESS IN FIXED MEMORY.
 0746           FOR BNKSUM PURPOSES, FIXED-FIXED IS INDICATED BY BANK NUMBERS 2 AND 3.

 0748   (3)     IF THE INDICATED BANK IS EMPTY, AND NO HIGHER BANK IS OCCUPIED, BNKSUM GENERATES NO WORDS, AND PRINTS
 0750           "NO NEED" IN THE ASSEMBLY LISTING.  THUS A COMPLETE LIST OF BNKSUM CARDS WILL SERVE A PROGRAM OF VARYING
 0752           LENGTH.

 0753   (4)     BNKSUM TRIES TO GENERATE TWO CONSECUTIVE ADRES-SELF WORDS, THAT IS, TC-TO-SELF WORDS FLAGGED AS CON-
 0755           STANTS TO STOP AN ALL-DIGITAL SIMULATION QUICKER THAN A TRUE TC-TO-SELF, IF EXECUTED.  THE PLACING OF
 0757           THE FIRST WORD IS GOVERNED BY A SEARCH FOR THE FIRST UNOCCUPIED WORD IN THE BANK, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
 0759           THE REST OF THE BANK IS EMPTY.  IN PARTICULAR, IF THE FOLLOWING LOCATION IS OCCUPIED, THE SECOND ADRES-
 0761           SELF WORD GOES THERE ANYWAY, WITH A CONFLICT CUSS.

 0762           IN THE BLK2 ASSEMBLER, AND IN AGC PROGRAM SUNBURST, SELFCHECK LOGIC REQUIRES BOTH ADRES-SELF WORDS
 0764   FOLLOWED BY A CHECKSUM WORD, THE LATTER CHOSEN SUCH THAT THE SUM OF ALL WORDS IN THE BANK ADD UP TO THE BANK
 0766   NUMBER.  THE SUM IS COMPUTED IN A SLIGHTLY SPECIAL WAY, WITH PLUS OR MINUS OVERFLOW BEING CARRIED END-AROUND AS
 0768   A PLUS OR MINUS 00001.  THE REQUIREMENT FOR BOTH ADRES-SELF WORDS MEANS THAT THE FIRST MAY BE PLACED NO LATER
 0770   THAN LOCATION 3775 OF THE BANK.  IF ALL WORDS 2000-3775 ARE OCCUPIED, THE ADRES-SELF WORDS GO INTO LOCATIONS
 0772   3775 AND 3776 WITH A CONFLICT CUSS.

 0773   BNKSUM (CONTINUED)

 0774           THE AGC ASSEMBLER RULES CORRESPOND TO A CHANGE IN SELFCHECK THAT WAS MADE AFTER BURST116 WAS FROZEN.
 0776   THE CHANGE IS THAT THE ADRES-SELF WORDS ARE PARTLY OR WHOLLY OMITTED IN A NEARLY FULL BANK.  THAT IS, IF
 0778   LOCATIONS 2000-3775 ARE OCCUPIED, EITHER OR BOTH OF THE ADRES-SELF WORDS ARE OMITTED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE
 0780   CHECKSUM WORD IS IN LOCATION 3777.  TO ELIMINATE CONFUSION ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF ROOM LEFT IN A BANK, THE AGC
 0782   BNKSUM PROCEDURE PRINTS THE NUMBER OF WORDS (IN DECIMAL) FROM THE LOCATION OF THE FIRST ADRES-SELF WORD THROUGH
 0784   LOCATION 3776, THAT IS, THE ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM OF WORDS THAT CAN BE ADDED IN THAT BANK AND STILL LEAVE ONE
 0786   LOCATION FOR THE CHECKSUM.  THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE CHECKSUM IN THE AGC ASSEMBLER IS DIFFERENT TOO: THE BANK
 0788   MUST ADD UP TO PLUS OR MINUS THE BANK NUMBER.  TO SEE WHY, IMAGINE THAT BANK 25 IS FULL AND THAT LOCATIONS
 0790   2000-3776 ADD UP (CHECKSUM-FASHION) TO 40000, OR -37777.  NOW NO CHECKSUM WORD CAN BE CHOSEN THAT WILL YIELD
 0792   00025 WHEN ADDED TO 40000, BUT A CHECKSUM WORD OF 37752 YIELDS 77752 = -25.  THIS CAN NEVER HAPPEN IN BLK2
 0794   BECAUSE THE LAST TWO WORDS BEFORE THE CHECKSUM WORD CONTRIBUTE AT LEAST +4001 TO THE SUM, WHICH THEREFORE HAS A
 0796   POSSIBLE RANGE OF -33774 TO +37777.  IF BNKSUM FINDS A BANK'S 1024D WORDS ALL OCCUPIED, IT PUTS 03777 INTO
 0798   LOCATION 3777 OF THE BANK, WITH A CONFLICT CUSS.

 0799           THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE COMPUTATION OF THE CHECKSUM WORD IN PASS 3.  IT WILL
 0801   ACCEPT THE FIRST CONSECUTIVE PAIR OF TC-SELFS (OR ADRES-SELFS) IN A BANK AS THE END-OF-BANK MARKER, AND TRY TO
 0803   PUT THE CHECKSUM WORD IN THE FOLLOWING LOCATION, BUT IT'S PERFECTLY HAPPY IF THERE IS NO SUCH PAIR (MEANING NO
 0805   CHECKSUM IS WANTED).  THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE IS TO GIVE YOU EITHER A CHECKSUM OR A REASON WHY NOT.  IF A BANK IS
 0807   COMPLETELY FILLED, WITH NO CONSECUTIVE PAIR OF TC-SELFS, THE LAST WORD IN THE BANK GETS THE PREFIX "NOSUM" IN
 0809   THE OCTAL STORAGE MAP.  IF THERE IS AN UNOCCUPIED LOCATION BEFORE ANY PAIR OF TC-SELFS, IT IS MARKED "NO
 0811   CHECKSUM," AND NO ATTEMPT IS MADE TO COMPUTE ONE.  IF A LOCATION IS EITHER A "BAD WORD" OR A "CONFLICT," THERE
 0813   IS NO CHECKSUM.  IF THE LOCATION WHERE THE CHECKSUM WORD SHOULD GO IS OCCUPIED, THE OFFENDING WORD IS PREFIXED
 0815   "=SUM" AND THE CHECKSUM IS ABANDONED.  IF ANY WORDS AFTER THE CHECKSUM WORD ARE OCCUPIED, THE FIRST IS PREFIXED
 0817   "=EOB" (END-OF-BANK ERROR).  THE PREFIXES BEGINNING WITH = COUNT AS CUSSED LINES.  A PECULAIR CASE ARISES IF THE
 0819   TC-SELFS ARE THE LAST TWO WORDS OF A PARAGRAPH BUT NOT THE END OF A BANK, AND THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH IS
 0821   UNOCCUPIED (BY EXPLICIT CODING, ANYWAY).  A PARAGRAPH MUST BE CREATED JUST FOR THE CHECKSUM WORD, AND THE ONLY
 0823   FACILITY THAT DOES IT AUTOMATICALLY IS THE BNKSUM ROUTINE IN THE AGC ASSEMBLER.

 0825           IN THE AGC COMPUTATION OF THE CHECKSUM WORD, THE RULE IS TO GIVE IT THE SMALLEST MAGNITUDE POSSIBLE.
 0827   IF THE SUM FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE BANK THROUGH THE LAST WORD BEFORE THE CHECKSUM IS POSITIVE (NEGATIVE), THE
 0829   CHECKSUM WORD IS CHOSEN TO MAKE THE WHOLE BANK ADD UP TO PLUS (MINUS) THE BANK NUMBER.  IN AGC OR BLK2, BY THE
 0831   WAY, BANK 00 HAS TO ADD UP TO 77777 (-0).


 0832   EBANK=

 0833           THE AGC ASSEMBLER REQUIRES THE ADDRESS VALUE FOR EBANK= TO BE AT LEAST 10 AND AT MOST 3777--THAT IS, AN
 0835   ADDRESS IN ERASABLE MEMORY.  THE BLK2 ASSEMBLER ALLOWS THESE, AND ALSO ALLOWS E-BANK NUMBERS 0-7.

 0837           THE AGC ASSEMBLER REQUIRES A ONE-SHOT EBANK= DECLARATION BEFORE EVERY BBCON OR BBCON* AND 2BCADR OR
 0839   2CADR;  THE BLK2 ASSEMBLER DOES NOT.


 0840   EDRUPT

 0841           THE BLK2 ASSEMBLER REGARDS EDRUPT AS AN IMPLIED-ADDRESS EXTRACODE AND ALWAYS ASSEMBLES IT 07000.  THE
 0843   AGC ASSEMBLER REGARDS IT AS A FULL EXTRACODE REQUIRING A FIXED-MEMORY ADDRESS, AND IT IS THE AGC PROGRAMMER'S
 0845   RESPONSIBILITY TO SEE THAT THE ADDRESS IS BETWEEN 7000 AND 7777.  THIS IS BECAUSE, IN THE FLIGHT-ROPE APPLICA-
 0847   TION, CONTROL RETURNS (AFTER CERTAIN RESUMES) TO THE EDRUPT INSTRUCTION, NOT TO THE EXTEND BEFORE IT, SO THAT IT
 0849   IS EXECUTED AS A TC INSTRUCTION.  SEE T5JOB IN SUNDANCE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

 0851   EVEN

 0852           THIS CODE TAKES NO LOCATION OR ADDRESS FIELDS.  IF THE LOCATION COUNTER VALUE IS EVEN, IT HAS NO EFFECT.
 0854   IF THE LOCATION COUNTER VALUE IS ODD, IT IS INCREMENTED.  THIS IS USEFUL IF IT'S DESIRED TO ALIGN DOUBLE-WORD
 0856   QUANTITIES ON EVEN LOCATIONS, WHICH INCIDENTALLY GUARDS AGAINST BANK-STRADDLING.  HOWEVER, IT SHOULD BE USED IN
 0858   CONJUNCTION WITH LEFTOVER CONSTANTS TO FILL UP THE RESULTING HOLE.  DON'T FEEL BAD IF YOU CAN'T USE IT.


 0860   MM

 0861           THIS CODE IS EQUIVALENT TO DEC EXCEPT THAT THE ARGUMENT IS LIMITED TO A MAGNITUDE OF 99.  IT WAS INTRO-
 0863   DUCED TO EASE THE TRANSITION FROM OCTAL TO DECIMAL MAJOR MODES, AND NOW HAS MOSTLY EYEBALL VALUE.


 0865   MODIFY

 0866           THIS CODE IS LISTED HERE MOSTLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE (LIKE THE YUL-360 PEOPLE) WHO READ THE YUL-
 0868   1800 PROGRAM.  THE CODE IS RECOGNIZED BUT IT IS NOT NOW INTENDED TO BE USED, AT LEAST IN FLIGHT PROGRAMS.  IT
 0870   TAKES NO LOCATION OR ADDRESS FIELD, AND ITS FUNCTION IS TO ACCEPT ALL CARD IMAGES COMING IN FROM TAPE IN A
 0872   REVISION OR VERSION ASSEMBLY OR FROM THE DISC IN A TRANSFERRED ASSEMBLY, UP TO AND INCLUDING THE NEXT "END OF"
 0874   CARD IMAGE, WHICH MARKS THE END OF EVERY PROGRAM AND SUBROUTINE FILE ON TAPE.  THEN FURTHER CHANGE CARDS FROM
 0876   THE CARD READER ARE MERGED WITH A SUBROUTINE CALLED BY THE MAIN PROGRAM, FOR THE DURATION OF THE CURRENT ASSEM-
 0878   BLY ONLY.  THE SUBROUTINE FILES ON TAPE ARE UNCHANGED.  THE YUL-360 PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO USE THE WORD
 0880   "MODIFY" IN THE SENSE OF "REVISE A SUBROUTINE."


 0881   SUBRO*

 0882           THIS CODE MAY ONLY BE USED IN A PROGRAM, I.E. SUBROUTINES CAN'T CALL OTHER SUBROUTINES.  THE SUPPRESSION
 0884   OF PRINTING CALLED FOR BY THE SUBDIRECTOR "SUPPRESS INACTIVE SUBROUTINES" WORKS THIS WAY: IF A SUBROUTINE HAS
 0886   NOT BEEN CHANGED SINCE THE LAST ASSEMBLY OF THE PORGRAM CALLING IT, IT IS "INACTIVE,"AND IF THE SUPPRESSION IS
 0888   ON, THE ONLY LINES PRINTED ARE THE "END OF" LINE AND ANY CUSSED LINE WITH ITS CUSSES.  THESE ARE MADE TO APPEAR
 0890   UNDER THEIR PROPER LOG SECTIONS.

 0891           A SUBROUTINE MAY BE MADE PERMANENTLY ACTIVE WITH RESPECT TO A GIVEN PROGRAM IF IT IS CALLED BY SUBRO*
 0893   INSTEAD OF SUBRO.  ALL SUBROUTINES CALLED IN A NEW, VERSION, OR TRANSFERRED PROGRAM ASSEMBLY ARE NECESSARILY
 0895   ACTIVE, SINCE A NEW PROGRAM IS BEING CREATED.


 0896   VN, <NV>

 0897           THIS IS A VARIATION ON DEC TO PACK TWO SEVEN-BIT FIELDS, REPRESENTING A VERB AND A NOUN, INTO ONE AGC
 0899   WORD.  THE VERB AND NOUN NUMBERS ARE WRITTEN IN THE ADDRESS FIELD IN DECIMAL, IN THE FORM VVNN (OR INDEED ANY
 0901   FORM ACCEPTABLE TO DEC THAT COMES TO THE SAME VALUE).  THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS EXPRESSION IS LIMITED TO 9999.
 0903   THE PARTS VV AND NN ARE IN EFFECT CONVERTED TO BINARY SEPARATELY AND PLACED IN BITS 14-8 AND 7-1 OF THE WORD,
 0905   RESPECTIVELY.

 0906   0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

 0907           THESE ARE THE ONLY NUMERIC OP CODES.  THEY ARE ALL REGARDED AS REGULAR CODES (NON-EXTRACODE) AND AS FULL
 0909   CODES, TAKING A 12-BIT ADDRESS PART.  THUS CODE 2, FOR INSTANCE, COULD STAND FOR DAS, LXCH, INCR, OR ADS, DE-
 0911   PENDING ON THE VALUE OF THE ADDRESS.  IT COULD ALSO STAND FOR MSU, QXCH, AUG, OR DIM IF THE PRECEDING WORD IS A
 0913   SECRET "EXTEND", I.E. OP CODE "0" AND ADDRESS "6".  A NUMERIC OP CODE IS USUALLY USED ONLY WHERE THE OP CODE
 0915   ITSELF WILL BE MODIFIED BY INDEXING.


 0916   2BCADR, 2CADR

 0917           IN THE AGC ASSEMBLER, THE E-BANK VALUE MUST BE GIVEN BY A ONE-SHOT EBANK= DECLARATION.  THIS IS OPTIONAL
 0919   IN BLK2.  IN EITHER ASSEMBLER, THE SUPER-BANK VALUE MAY BE GIVEN BY A ONE-SHOT SBANK= DECLARATION.  SEE ALSO THE
 0921   NOTE ON BBCON.
