# THIS LIST IS MAINTAINED TO ENSURE THAT CERTAIN ERASABLE LOCATIONS
# ARE LOCATED AT A SPECIFIED DISTANCE FROM ANOTHER ERASABLE LOCATION
# AS REQUIRED BY THE STRUCTURE OF THE DOWNLINK LISTS:
#       1. IF A LOCATION IS THE SECOND PART OF A DOWNLINK WORD, IT MUST
#          BE CONTIGUOUS TO THE LOCATION THAT IS THE FIRST PART.
#       2. IF A LOCATION IS NOT THE FIRST WORD OF AN NDNADR IT
#          MUST BE AT A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF LOCATIONS FROM THE FIRST
#          LOCATION IN THE INSTRUCTION.
#       3. OTHER NAMES MAY BE GIVEN TO LOCATIONS IN THE DOWNLIND LISTS
#          THAT ARE NOT REFERENCED IN THE LISTS. THESE MUST NOT BE MOVED.
# THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED USING THE INSTRUCTION    CHECK=   .
# THIS INSTRUCTION GIVES A CUSS IN THE ASSEMBLY IF THE LOCATION OF THE
# FIRST TAG FIELD IS NOT EQUAL TO THE LOCATION OF THE SECOND TAG FIELD.
# THE INSTRUCTION HAS NO OTHER EFFECT ON THE ASSEMBLY OR CODE.

# THIS LIST SHOULD BE UPDATED FOR ANY CHANGES TO THE DOWNLINK LISTS.
