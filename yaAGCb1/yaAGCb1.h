 * Filename:    yaAGC-Block1.h
 * Purpose:     Header for Block 1 AGC simulator.
 * Compiler:    GNU gcc.
 * Contact:     Ron Burkey <info@sandroid.org>
 * Reference:   http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/index.html
 * Mods:        2016-09-03 RSB  Began the Block 1 AGC simulator.  I'm succumbing
 *                              to the temptation of starting clean, rather than
 *                              trying to build upon the existing yaAGC (Block 2)
 *                              simulator, or on my port of John Pultorak's
 *                              Block 1 simulator.
 *              2016-09-27 RSB  Added stuff for DSRUPT.
 *
 * It is important to note that this simulator operates at the basic instruction
 * level and *not* at the control-pulse level, much like the original Block 2
 * yaAGC.  It deals with lower-level structures only when it is impossible to
 * avoid (which is seldom).  This is in contrast to John Pultorak's Block 1
 * simulator, also available under the overall umbrella of the Virtual AGC project,
 * which operates entirely at the pulse-sequence level, and provides higher-level
 * information about the basic assembly-language instructions only as an afterthought.
 * The latter approach is very suited to modeling the underlying hardware, but not
 * so much for efficient development or simulation of code execution.  That is
 * a large part of the reason why this replacement simulator is being written.
 * However, validation of this simulator against the behavior of the Pultorak
 * simulator, on an instruction by instruction basis, is an important development
 * tool for this simulator.
