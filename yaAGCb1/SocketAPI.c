 * Filename:	SocketAPI.c
 * Purpose:	This is an implementation of yaAGC-to-peripheral
 * 		communications by means of a socket interface.  If some
 * 		other means of communications is desired, such as a
 * 		memory-mapped i/o-channel interface, just replace the
 * 			functions in this file with alternate functions.
 * Compiler:	GNU gcc.
 * Contact:	Ron Burkey <info@sandroid.org>
 * Reference:	http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/index.html
 * Mods:	08/18/04 RSB.	Split off from agc_engine.c.
 *		02/27/05 RSB	Added the license exception, as required by
 * 				the GPL, for linking to Orbiter SDK libraries.
 * 		05/14/05 RSB	Corrected website references.
 * 		05/15/05 RSB	Fixed bug in which counter increments
 * 				would endlessly recur.  SOCKET_API_C added
 * 				for agc_engine.h.
 * 		05/31/05 RSB	--debug-deda mode.
 * 		06/05/05 RSB	Corrected polarity of discretes in
 * 				--debug-deda mode.  Corrected positioning
 * 				of bits in the "input discretes".
 * 		06/07/05 RSB	Fixed bit positioning in DEDA shift
 * 				register.
 * 		06/26/05 RSB	Accounted for uplinked data.
 * 		07/09/05 RSB	Accounted for rotational hand controller (RHC)
 * 				in LM. In retrospect, this is a bad place
 * 				to handle it, since it won't automatically
 * 				be handled in NullAPI.c.  I'll worry about
 * 				that later.
 * 		03/11/09 RSB	Added casts of various char types (unsigned
 * 				char, char, const char) to other char types
 * 				for function parameters.  Without these,
 * 				there were fatal compilation errors with
 * 				some versions of g++.
 * 		03/18/09 RSB	Removed printed messages about adding/removing
 * 				sockets when the DebugMode flag is set.
 * 				Added some robustness checking to the
 * 				data stream on the tcp port.
 * 		03/19/09 RSB	Added DedaQuiet.
 * 		11/18/16 RSB	Worked around lack of MSG_NOSIGNAL in Solaris.
 * 				Added missing unistd.h.
