 * Filename:	nbfgets.c
 * Purpose:	A portable (i.e., Linux AND Win32) non-blocking variant of fgets.
 * 		Requires pthreads (on *nix) or "POSIX Threads for Win32"
 * 		(http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/).
 * Compiler:	GNU gcc.
 * Contact:	Ron Burkey <info@sandroid.org>
 * Reference:	http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/index.html
 * Mods:	08/09/04 RSB.	Began.
 * 		02/27/05 RSB	Added the license exception, as required by
 * 				the GPL, for linking to Orbiter SDK libraries.
 * 		05/14/05 RSB	Corrected website references.
 * 		07/13/05 RSB	Fixed the of using too much CPU time in Win32.
 * 		07/30/05 JMS    Added use of GNU libreadline to read in the
 * 		                debug command, and source file name completion.
 * 		08/13/05 RSB	Added an initializer for nbfgetsCond, on the
 * 				advice of "grosman".
 * 		06/13/08 OH	Intercept rl_getc_function to ignore LF
 * 		04/24/09 RSB	Added some conditioning for some readline stuff.
 * 		08/01/09 RSB	I believe that the return value of readline()
 * 				was being treated incorrectly, in that EOF was
 * 				being checked for in the returned string when
 * 				actually the returned string would be NULL,
 * 				thus causing a segfault.  Also, added WIN32-only
 * 				checking for goofiness in the return values of
 * 				readline() and rl_getc().
 * 		08/02/09 RSB	Tried to make it work again without readline
 * 				support.
 * 		11/22/10 RSB    Eliminated a compiler warning I encountered
 *                              in Ubuntu 10.04.
 *              09/03/16 RSB    Pulled this into yaAGC-Block1-Pultorak/ from
 *                              yaAGC/, because I don't want dependencies,
 *                              because I'm developing in a different branch
 *                              of the git repo, in which yaAGC/ doesn't exist,
 *                              and simplified ... not a value judgement on the
 *                              stuff I removed, just trying to achieve maximal
 *                              simplicity for myself at this exact instant in
 *                              time.  The original stuff still exists in yaAGC
 *                              and could be substituted if desired.
